Background
====================================================================
The data in file analysis_result.txt contains the analysis done on the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Analysis carried out by Darui Xu
For the course project "Getting and Cleaning Data" John Hopkins Coursera
====================================================================
====================================================================
The HAR data set has 30 participants. Each wears a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist, while performing six activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, AND LAYING.
The embedded accelerometer and gyroscope captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hzfrom the participants. For detailed description of the experiment, please refer to the following publication: 
Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

Specification for the assignment:
====================================================================
For this Assignment, extracted the mean and standard deviation (std) measurements out of the 561 features captured in the HAR dataset. There are a total of 79 features in the analysis_result.txt dataset. Each row represents the mean value of the specified feature for each participant while performing a specific activity. Since there are 30 participants, 6 activities and 79 features, there are a total of 14220 (30*6*79) observations.

Description of features:
Note: according to the original dataset description, each feature is normalized. Therefore, there is no unit for each value. Each value will fall between -1 and 1.
