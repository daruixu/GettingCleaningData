Background====================================================================The data in file analysis_result.txt contains the analysis done on the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Analysis carried out by Darui XuFor the course project "Getting and Cleaning Data" John Hopkins Coursera========================================================================================================================================The HAR data set has 30 participants. Each wears a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist, while performing six activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, AND LAYING.The embedded accelerometer and gyroscope captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hzfrom the participants. For detailed description of the experiment, please refer to the following publication: Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012====================================================================Specification for the assignment:====================================================================For this Assignment, extracted the mean and standard deviation (std) measurements out of the 561 features captured in the HAR dataset. There are a total of 79 features in the analysis_result.txt dataset. Each row represents the mean value of the specified feature for each participant while performing a specific activity. Since there are 30 participants, 6 activities and 79 features, there are a total of 14220 (30*6*79) observations.====================================================================Description of features:Note: according to the original dataset description, each feature is normalized. Therefore, there is no unit for each value.
